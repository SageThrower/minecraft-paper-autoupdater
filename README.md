# Minecraft python paper autoupdater
VERY simple paper updated written in python

It basically uses the paper download api to check for updates and if any updates are available they are downloaded

# How to use
Get the start.py
Run the start.py

If you need to change the minecraft version, the launch script code, the servers ram or the launch script name open the python file with any text/code editor and change the variables at the top (The ones in caps lock)
